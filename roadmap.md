* Integration of other well documented, adopted and open standards. Suggest [here](https://smartdatamodels.org/index.php/submit-an-issue-2/)

* Integration with other tools like data spaces, open data portals, any tool for data sharing. Suggest [here](https://smartdatamodels.org/index.php/submit-an-issue-2/)

* Creation of the pysmartdatamodels with all the attributes, data models and functions to extra info from them

* There is an option in smartdatamodels.org for listing other [initiatives pending](https://smartdatamodels.org/index.php/smart-data-models-wish-list/)

* Automation of the testing tools to check consistency within the data models
  * Changing the data models to include all the comments in the json schema

* Adopt additional Data Models from: 
- [Fiware4Water](https://www.fiware4water.eu/) belonging to the ICT4water cluster in Europe. In progress

* Validate NGSI-LD content.
The validation tool (see [tools repository](https://github.com/smart-data-models/tools)) has to be tweaked to perform NGSI-LD validation of examples
, once Orion-LD is in a more mature state. In progress.
