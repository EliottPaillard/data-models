# Structure
All terms has to be in an object called @context
Every term mapped has to be in extended version (without acronyms:). so schema:date is not valid while https:://schema.org/date yes
## in example

{

  "@context": {

      "text1": "https:/schema.org/test1",

       "text2": "https:/schema.org/test2"

  }

}
