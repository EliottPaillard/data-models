# How to work in a group to code a data model

## Methodology 
It is supposed that there is a group willing to create a data model for a shared interest.
This methodology will help you to achieve it.

### Step 0 Gather documentation
- Set a group leader.  
- Gather documentation of actual use cases between group members or beyond.
- Smart Data Models initiative is focused on actual use of data.
- Therefore it is required that the data models to be created are based on actual experience of use.
   
### Step 1. Compile elements.
- Use the [incbuated repository](https://github.com/smart-data-models/incubated/tree/master) or if not convenient, create a shared repository (shared folder, drive, etc) for compile all the documentation.
- Share it with group members 
- What can you compile there? 
    - Documentation examples
    - Payload examples. Actual values of the existing experiences
    - Regulations that it could affect it.

### Step 2. Meet to reach a Generalization proposal
- Hold the amount of meetings to reach a basic level of shared utility data model
- The [guidelines](guidelines.md) provides not only technical recommendations but also valuable functional recommendations
- Review other existing [data models](https://smartdatamodels.org/index.php/ddbb-of-properties-descriptions/) that could affect yours  

### Step 3. Internal validation
- Try to reach a minimum shared elements to be approved by a majority

### Step 4. Create the technical documentation of a data model 
    - Payload Examples: json [template](https://github.com/smart-data-models/data-models/blob/master/templates/dataModel/example1.json) and json-ld [template](https://github.com/smart-data-models/data-models/blob/master/templates/dataModel/example1.jsonld)
    - json schema: 
- Voluntary documents 
    - CONTRIBUTORS.yaml: Who want to be attribute as author [template](https://github.com/smart-data-models/data-models/blob/master/templates/Subject/CONTRIBUTORS.md)
    - Adopters.yaml: Examples of use of the data model [template](https://github.com/smart-data-models/data-models/blob/master/templates/dataModel/CURRENT-ADOPTERS.md)  

### Step 5. Submit your data model
    - Create a Pull request on the right repository of in [incubated](https://github.com/smart-data-models/incubated/tree/master) if you do not which one.
   
### Step 6. Review
- Once submitted some review will be done to check if data model meet coding [guidelines](guidelines.md)
- Maybe some of its elements could be extracted for general use in other domains.
- Some information to create the right [context](https://github.com/smart-data-models/data-models/blob/master/context.jsonld) could be requested as well. 

### Step 7. Disseminate
- A model only is useful for you if someone else use it. Let them know it exists.
