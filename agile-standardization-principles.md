# Agile standardizaation principles 

Agile data standardization is based on a few principles:

0.- Be differentially agile

1.- Do not renormalize

2.- Normalize real cases

3.- Be open

4.- Generalize as much as possible

5.- Have a vocation for continuity

## 0. Be differentially agile
This zero principle would be to remedy or at least be different from the classic standardization in terms of agility. What in classical standardization is measured in months and years in agile should be measured in terms of days or weeks. This initial principle implies that the activities must be as automated as possible and, on the other hand, with the least amount of human intervention possible. As humans, in addition to our valuable contributions, we tend both to introduce errors (which will cause problems in automated processes) and to delay decision processes, something that goes against the principle of agility.

## 1. Do not renormalize
The first principle states that what is already used on the market and has an open license should not be standardized again. Here it is worth emphasizing the use of the market, beyond the pure generation of standards. Too often standardizations (in the form of ontologies and vocabularies) are found that are looking for users, rather than solving real problems and identifying the entities and attributes that are needed.

## 2. Normalize real cases
The second principle states that agile standardization should only be based on real cases that have proven their usefulness in market situations.

## 3. Be open
The third principle is simple, given that in many cases agile standardization is  based on regulations with an open license, it would nobe consistent release the results without an open license, if possible. The open license has to allow free  reuse, modification and sharing of modifications.

## 4. Generalize as much as possible
The fourth principle is that of generalization. Although data models have to solve market problems, it is easy to start from very particular cases. There, the agile standardization entity must reach a consensus in order to make the model cover as many cases as possible, for example by limiting the number of mandatory attributes, without introducing complexities in the generated data models.

## 5. Have a vocation for continuity
The last principle is that of continuity. the agile standardization initiative has to be with a continuation aim and not being a project-driven effort. Therefore sustainability mechanism should be in place.
